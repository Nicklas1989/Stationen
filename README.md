# Stationen

Here you can find everything about my bachelorthesis i wrote at HS Pforzheim, Germany.

You can find the thesis itself, aswell as all Data that is used for the utility analysis and the AHP.

The exercise shows a number of stations.

Each station shows of some capabilities of Aframe.

The goal is to give people the tools to build their own world with Aframe with as less as possible codeing knowlege.
